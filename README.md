# Drifblim

[Drifblim](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/drifblim) is a [Uxntal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html) assembler, written in that same language. 

The assembler is written in about 400 lines, it's designed to help bootstrap the Uxn ecosystem and to demonstrate the concept of a personal one-page computer concept. The goal is for Driflim's source code to be released as a print-friendly document, along with its assembled hexadecimal data and the napkin definition of the Uxn virtual machine.

The Drifblim project also a REPL program, called the `bicycle`. More on this later.

## Build

This assembler is written in the language it is assembling, creating a chicken-and-egg problem. You have two choices, download a pre-assembled [drifblim.rom](https://rabbits.srht.site/drifblim/drifblim.rom)(1300 bytes), or use [uxnasm.c](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/main/item/src/uxnasm.c). 

```sh
# from uxnasm
uxnasm src/drifblim.tal bin/drifblim.rom
# from drifblim.rom
uxncli bin/drifblim.rom src/drifblim.tal 
```

If do not wish to assemble it yourself, you can download [drifblim.rom](https://rabbits.srht.site/drifblim/drifblim.rom).

## TODOs

- Warn at program limit.
- Display program size/limit.
- Display reference memory limit.
- Display success message.

_Drifblim is strong enough to lift Pok√©mon or people but has no control over its flight. This causes it to drift with the wind and end up anywhere._
